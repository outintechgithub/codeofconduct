Out in Tech Slack Code of Conduct

Welcome! This is the official public Slack channel for the Out in Tech community. This is a place for the entire community to chat, commiserate, and be merry!

Membership: This is a public, but invitation-only slack. The reason for this is to keep a degree of control over who can gain access, and to keep a safe and welcoming space for everyone! Feel free to invite folks that you think would appreciate, contribute, and/or benefit from being apart of this community of awesome folks.

Engage: Your constructive contributions matter! Your questions are welcome and valid. Your participation makes Out in Tech a better community. Stay active and engaged as much as you’d like.

Include: Use inclusive vocabulary, be kind, and be open to learning about everyone's varied experiences of life. This means refraining from derogatory language related to a gender(s), sexual orientation or preference(s), physical or mental dis/ability, race, class, religion, and life choices including those of a financial, employment or health-related nature. We also encourage you to include your pronouns next to your name!

Respect: Debate and discuss constructively! No name-calling or mean-spirited comments. Be agreeable, even when you disagree. We have a zero tolerance for hate, and you will be removed for any hateful messages.

Semi-professional: Please consider this space may be used by individuals of all ages and backgrounds, and keep content to a semi-professional tone. No explicit images or graphic language.

Clean: Read the description of the channel you are posting in and ask if it’s the best spot for your questions or comments. Avoid cross-posting to more than one channel if possible. Find the best place for your post and trust it will reach the desired audience! 

Shine: We 100% want you to use the OIT community to advance your career. Share or promote yourself in the right channels (like #jobs, #announcements, or our city based channels), and we’ll be here cheering you on. That being said, please don’t flood or spam the channels. We suggest keeping general promotions to 2x per week, and if you’re promoting an event no more than 2x total. And if you’re hiring, make sure the position is paid! Economic empowerment is a great way to support the LGBTQ+ community. 

Confidentality: Please be mindful of the sensitivity of this space. Being an LGBT community, it's important that we respect one another’s privacy. Don't attribute things said to, or reveal the identity of, folks in this slack without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s).

The Small Print

Warnings: If you are being inappropriate, but it is likely coming from a place of ignorance rather than malice, you will be DM’d by one of the Slack admins requesting that you adjust your behavior and/or remove your posts. 
Removal: We reserve the right to delete any post, or remove any member of the community for not following the above community guidelines.

Private Channels: For privacy reasons, we’ve made the #trans-nonbinary-nonconforming channel private. If you’d like to join it, reach out to Anuva Kalawar or Gary Goldman. 

Adding Channels: As of now, only administrators have the ability to create new channels. If you feel strongly about the creation of a new channel, reach out to us!
